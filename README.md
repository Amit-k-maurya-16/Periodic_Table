# Periodic_Table

The Periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements orderedby the atomic number,electronic configuration and 
recurring chemical propertieswhose adopted structure shows periodic properties.The Modern Periodic table was actually 
discovered by the Russian chemistDimitri Mendeleev in the year 1971.This is a brief Thesis of a project on 
Modern Periodic Table which has actu-ally been created by three students :
-

Samyak Raj(16103010),
Amit KumarMaurya(16103023)and,
Ashish Ranjan(16103007).


The Project has actually been created on the Qt platform with version 5.5.1 in C++ and ubuntu 16.04.  We the three students work as a team to 
design this periodic table which shows Atomic Number,Atomic symbol,atomic weight,electronicconfiguration,Year of Discovery,
Name of the Discovererand,  an-other necessary information for each and every element.We acknowledge our project of
Object Oriented Programming which we cre-ated created by using Qt platform in a way such thatwe really want to thank Pankaj Sir
for telling us to do the project on such a useful platform called ,Qt.We are oblige of him as we learn a very new thing.
What we have actually done is that we have created Push buttonfor each of the 118 elements of the periodic table in the (.ui) 
extension called the user inter-face.  
On clicking the push button of any of the 118 elements we are displaying all of its necessary details.We are actually using 
adatabaseto handle the details of all the elements,by creating different tables for the elements.
